# Cannonball
The evil red cannonball (main NPC, controlled by a **finite-state machine AI**) lives with the others shy black cannonballs (support NPCs) in an **endless, procedurally generated, snowy forest**. The player now enjoys the privilege of attending their amusing activities.

The black ones may be very shy, but that reduces their destructive abilities not in the slightest. By contrast, the red ball is not shy at all: is it once at your heels, you will only get rid of it with speed. The jump and sprint ability of the player proves to be very useful in that case. However, at the beginning, the clingy one is imprisoned and only you can free it - if you want that. Should you, despite the questionable character, have pity with the locked away cannonball, you can find it in that single house with an automatic door opening only for the player. Yet, be aware, once freed, it will always look for you and indeed in a totally unpredictable way (deliberately chosen). A little protection from the acute, red harassment offers a platform with another house, whose door opens/closes by pressing the F-key. On this platform, there is also a pressure-sensitive plate, stand on it and a :musical_note:short piece of music:musical_note: is played. The platform also features an invisible volume (trigger, marked by a plate) - as long as the game character resides in it, :fireworks:fireworks:fireworks: are shot into the sky.

Yes, the world is a little scary. To make things worse you can always see the current state of the red cannonball AI.
