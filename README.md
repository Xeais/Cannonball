# :video_game: Cannonball
The evil red cannonball (main NPC, controlled by a **finite-state machine AI**) lives with the others shy black cannonballs (support NPCs) in an **endless, procedurally generated snowy world whith a forest**. The player now enjoys the privilege of attending their amusing activities.

The black ones may be very shy - they flee if you come to close, in doing so no tree is deep-rooted enough to stop them. By contrast, the red ball is not shy at all: is it once at your heels, you will only get rid of it with speed. The jump and sprint ability of the player proves to be very useful in that case. However, at the beginning, the clingy one is imprisoned and only you can free it - if you want that. Should you, despite the questionable character, have pity with the locked away cannonball, you can find it in that single small house with an automatic door opening only for the player. Yet, be aware, once freed, it will always look for you and indeed in a totally unpredictable way (deliberately chosen). A little protection from the acute, red harassment offers a platform with another little house, whose door opens/closes by pressing the F-key. On this platform, there is also a pressure-sensitive plate, stand on it and a short piece of music is played. The platform also features an invisible volume (trigger, marked by a plate) - as long as the game character resides in it, :fireworks:fireworks:fireworks: are shot into the sky.
